# Git and GitHub

Git is a source code management / version control tool that is extremely
efficient and powerful. While often considered to be for team use, it is still
very powerful for individual use and, combined with GitHub, is the premier
location for deploying packages, frameworks, templates, etc. for some of the
most popular programming languages.

Created by Linus Torvalds, also the creator of Linux, it is the go-to tool for
version control of source code.
